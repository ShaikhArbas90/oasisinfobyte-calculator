Sure, here's a brief description of a calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML provides the basic structure of the calculator. In this case, it includes an input element to display the current calculation and a series of button elements to capture user input.

CSS is used to style the calculator's appearance. This can include setting the font size, color, and background color of the buttons, as well as positioning them within the calculator.

JavaScript provides the calculator's functionality. This includes listening for button clicks, updating the display with the user's input, and performing the requested arithmetic operations.

Overall, a calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be a great way to practice these three technologies and learn how they work together.
